      <h2>About Girls in the Garden</h2>
    </div>
    <p>Thank you for the opportunity of letting you know a little more about Girls in the Garden Gardening Services.</p>

    <p>Girls in the Garden Gardening Services was founded in 2020 by Jodie Bennett when she recognized a gap in the market which she felt required a specialized gardening service.</p>

    <p>Jodie was regularly working with NDIS clients and vulnerable people, who required an extra level of care.</p>

    <p>The feedback she received from clients was that most gardeners tended to “Whip in with a lawn mower and a whipper snipper and then whip out” - often leaving a mess and rarely getting any weeding or pruning done.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, they were usually late and even worse, regularly failed to show up at all.</p>

    <p>A lot of clients were widowed women, elderly and alone in their homes for the first time in their lives.</p>

    <p>With that in mind, Jodie (along with her business partner, Catherine) set out to begin a different kind of business.</p>

    <p>A business that takes pride in the details, in reliability and making our clients feel safe.</p>

    <p>A business that provides a high quality of care and service that at the same time empowers women to re-enter the workforce.</p>

    <p>When Girls in the Garden was launched, our main goals were:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A focus on customer service</li>
      <li>Building relationships and trust with clients</li>
      <li>Providing quality garden care</li>
      <li>Paying attention to detail and taking care of the smaller jobs, which are often overlooked</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The response was overwhelmingly positive.</p>

    <p>Clients felt heard and understood - and their gardens reflected the results of better communication.</p>

    <p>They felt safe in their own homes. And were thrilled to feel seen and heard as they built consistent relationships with our gardening team.</p>

    <p>Since 2020, we have grown quickly and evolved naturally along the way.</p>

    <p>Originating in Frankston, we now cover all Peninsula Suburbs from Mount Eliza to Portsea and we have clients in Seaford, Chelsea, Aspendale, Bentleigh, Glen Iris and beyond.</p>

    <p>We have recently acquired new jobs in Kensington and Footscray and are excited to enter into the inner city market.</p>

    <p>Our team which began with Jodie has now grown to a team of 15+ amazing Gardeners with a wealth of knowledge and skills to share.</p>

    <p>Every member of our team has a caring and positive nature and are able to adapt to any client's specific needs.</p>

    <p>We employ both female and male gardeners. Some clients will choose to deal exclusively with women, others are happy with a man from the team. Either way, we assure quality care and service.</p>

    <p>We are excited to have the chance to work with you moving forward as we continue to grow. We have recently introduced cleaning services to our menu as well as guttering, pressure washing and in-home care.</p>
